"""
The following introduces the :py:func:`TransmissionMatrix class
<pyfar.classes.transmission_matrix.TransmissionMatrix>` available in pyfar.

Transmission matrices (short T-matrices) are a convenient representation of
`Two-ports` (or `Quadrupoles`). These can represent systems from various fields,
e.g. electrical circuits, mechanical vibration, (acoustic) transmission lines.

Systems can be cascaded my multiplying consecutive T-matrices. Furthermore,
properties like input impedance of transfer functions can directly be derived.

class TransmissionMatrix(FrequencyData):
    """ Class representing a transmission matrix

    This implementation is based on a paper by Lampton [#]_ and uses the ABCD-
    representation. A single T-matrix is a (2x2)-matrix of the form:
        [A  B]
        [C  D]
    This class represents frequency-dependent matrix of a multi-dimensional form,
    i.e. A, B, C and D can be matrices as well. For this purpose, it is derived
    from the :py:class:`~FrequencyData` class. In the easiest case, each matrix entry
    (A,B,C,D) is a vector depending on frequency. However, additional dimensions
    can be used to represent additional variables (e.g. multiple layouts of an
    electrical circuit).

    Notes
    -----
    This class is derived from :py:class:`~FrequencyData` but has a special constraint:
    The frequency data must match a shape like [..., 2, 2, N]. The last axis refers to
    the frequency, and the two axes before to the ABCD-Matrix (which is a 2x2 matrix).
    For example, `obj.freq[...,0,0,:]` returns the data related to the A-entry.

        data : array, double
            Raw data in the frequency domain. The memory layout of Data is 'C'.
            In contrast to the :py:class:`~FrequencyData` class, data must have a shape

            In those examples 1024 refers to the number of frequency bins and
            the two dimensions before that to the (2x2) ABCD matrices.
            Supported data types are ``int``, ``float`` or ``complex``, where
            ``int`` is converted to ``float``.
        frequencies : array, double

            the size of the last dimension of data.
        comment : str, optional
