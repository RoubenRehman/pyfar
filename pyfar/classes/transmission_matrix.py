The following introduces the :py:class:`~TransmissionMatrix` class available
in pyfar.

Transmission matrices (short T-matrices) are a convenient representation of
`Two-ports` (or `Quadrupoles`). These can represent systems from various
fields, e.g. electrical circuits, mechanical vibration, (acoustic) transmission
lines.

Systems can be cascaded my multiplying consecutive T-matrices. Furthermore,
properties like input impedance of transfer functions can directly be derived.

class TransmissionMatrix(FrequencyData):
    r"""Class representing a transmission matrix

    This implementation is based on a paper by Lampton [#]_ and uses the ABCD-
    representation. A single T-matrix is a (2x2)-matrix of the form:

    .. math::
        T = \begin{bmatrix}
                A & B \\
                C & D
            \end{bmatrix}

    This class represents frequency-dependent matrix of a multi-dimensional
    form, i.e. A, B, C and D can be matrices as well. For this purpose, it is
    derived from the :py:class:`~pyfar.classes.audio.FrequencyData` class. In
    the easiest case, each matrix entry (A,B,C,D) is a single-channel
    FrequencyData object (i.e. a vector depending on frequency). However,
    additional dimensions can be used to represent additional variables (e.g.
    multiple layouts of an electrical circuit).

    Notes
    -----
    This class is derived from the :py:class:`~pyfar.classes.audio.FrequencyData`
    but has a special constraint: The input data must match a shape like
    (..., 2, 2, N), so the resulting cshape is (...,2,2). The last axis refers
    to the frequency, and the two axes before to the ABCD-Matrix (which is a
    2x2 matrix). For example, `obj[...,0,0]` returns the A-entry as
    :py:class:`~pyfar.classes.audio.FrequencyData`.

    Another point is the numerical handling when deriving input/output
    impedance or transfer functions (see :py:func:`~input_impedance`,
    :py:func:`~output_impedance`, :py:func:`~transfer_function`):
    In the respective equations, the load impedance Zl is usually multiplied.
    This can lead to numerical problems for Zl = inf. Thus, Zl is applied in
    the form of 1/Zl (as admittance) in this case to avoid such problems.
    Nevertheless, there are additional cases where certain entries of the
    T-matrix being zero might still lead to the main denominator becoming zero.
    For these cases, the denominator is set to eps.
