"""
The following introduces the :py:class:`~TransmissionMatrix` class available in pyfar.

Transmission matrices (short T-matrices) are a convenient representation of
`Two-ports` (or `Quadrupoles`). These can represent systems from various fields,
e.g. electrical circuits, mechanical vibration, (acoustic) transmission lines.

Systems can be cascaded my multiplying consecutive T-matrices. Furthermore,
properties like input impedance of transfer functions can directly be derived.

class TransmissionMatrix(FrequencyData):
    """Class representing a transmission matrix

    This implementation is based on a paper by Lampton [#]_ and uses the ABCD-
    representation. A single T-matrix is a (2x2)-matrix of the form::

        [A  B]
        [C  D]

    This class represents frequency-dependent matrix of a multi-dimensional form,
    i.e. A, B, C and D can be matrices as well. For this purpose, it is derived
    from the :py:class:`~pyfar.classes.audio.FrequencyData` class. In the easiest
    case, each matrix entry (A,B,C,D) is a vector depending on frequency.
    However, additional dimensions can be used to represent additional variables
    (e.g. multiple layouts of an electrical circuit).

    Notes
    -----
    This class is derived from the :py:class:`~pyfar.classes.audio.FrequencyData` but
    has a special constraint: The frequency data must match a shape like [..., 2, 2, N].
    The last axis refers to the frequency, and the two axes before to the ABCD-Matrix
    (which is a 2x2 matrix). For example, `obj.freq[...,0,0,:]` returns the data related
    to the A-entry.

            bins and the two dimensions before that to the (2x2) ABCD matrices.
            Supported data types are ``int``, ``float`` or ``complex``, where
